## Vellum: An abstract object model for printable documents

Vellum is going to be a domain model for the kinds of elements that 
go into printable documents, and may be useful for simplifying
projects like [Prawn](http://github.com/prawnpdf/pdf) and
[Bookie](http://github.com/sandal/bookie). But it is equally likely
to become abandonware, this is just an experiment!
